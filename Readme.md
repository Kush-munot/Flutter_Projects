### Day 1: [16th August]

**Today's Progress:**
- Set up Flutter development environment and Installation

**Thoughts:**
Getting started was exciting! Dart's syntax feels familiar like C++ and Java syntax.

**Today's Progress:**

**Thoughts:**
Consistency is important and will try to mantain the consistency

- Solved 2 question on HashMaps [Twice_Counter and Word_With_Max_Freq]
- Learnt Sorting of HashMaps on Value.

**Thoughts:**
Getting resources on Data Structures in Dart is damn difficult. But somehow articles and
