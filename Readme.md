# Flutter and Dart Learning Progress

Welcome to my Flutter and Dart learning journey! This README serves as a log to track my daily progress as I explore and improve my skills in app development using Flutter and Dart. Feel free to follow along or provide any feedback.

## Current Goals

- [ ] Learn basic Dart and its syntaxes.
- [ ] Build a basic Flutter app
- [ ] Understand state management in Flutter
- [ ] Explore UI design with Flutter widgets
- [ ] Create a simple CRUD app using Flutter and Dart

## Daily Log

### Day 1: [16th August]

**Today's Progress:**
- Set up Flutter development environment and Installation
- Created my first Dart program
- Explored basic Dart Datatypes like String, Integers, Booleans

**Thoughts:**
Getting started was exciting! Dart's syntax feels familiar like C++ and Java syntax.

### Day 2: [21th August]

**Today's Progress:**
- Started with Loops in Dart
- Taking User Inputs in Dart
- Started using List Data Structure in Dart
- Learned to run Dart program in Terminal rather than Debug Console.
- Solved two question of List but was struggling with dividion operator as we have int as data type and division gives double as output but then discovered this ~/ truncated division operator that worked ü•≥ü•≥

**Thoughts:**
Consistency is important and will try to mantain the consistency 

### Day 3: [22th August]

**Today's Progress:**
- Got to know about ?? in Dart. It Called also null operator. This operator returns expression on its left, except if it is null, and if so, it returns right expression.
- Started with HashMaps in Dart. 
- Wrote Basic Array element frequency code. [PS - C++ is better in Dart all those null value errors and type checks make things horrible]
- Solved 2 question on HashMaps [Twice_Counter and Word_With_Max_Freq]
- Learnt Sorting of HashMaps on Value.

**Thoughts:**
Getting resources on Data Structures in Dart is damn difficult. But somehow articles and blogs help me a lot 

### Day 4: [24th August]

**Today's Progress:**
- Started learning Sets in Dart
- Solved 2 Problems in Set - Common Sum and Distinct Difference
- Made problems user input centric and tested for different testcases too.

**Thoughts:**
Today it was easy to find things and getting accquainted to the learning process.

### Day 5: [27th August]

**Today's Progress:**
- Learned about Classes and Object in Dart.
- This helped me deign Node Class for LinkedList.
- Created basic code for Insertion at Beginning and Insertion at End in Dart.
- Solved 2 Questions Reverse LinkedList and Find Nth Node from End. 
- Also did basics of Stack and Queue in Dart

**Thoughts:**
- To start of with LinkedList was a bit tough. Got to serach for proper source but then it became easier to code.
  
### Day 6: [28th August]

**Today's Progress:**
- Learned about different Folders in a dart project and what happens in each of them.
- Tried to play around with the main.dart file which is the starting point of the flutter app

**Thoughts:**
- It was nice to start with flutter and run the basic app on emulator.
### Day 7: [29th August]

**Today's Progress:**
- main.dart is parsed from top to bottom when we run the project.
- the parsed code is compiled to target platform code some native android code or IOS Code.
- Tried to write the main.dart from scratch. 
- runApp() is the funcetion that starts the app and its main function is to show some UI on the screen
- We can Manage 3rd party dependencies in the pubspec.yaml files
- For rendering UI on Flutter App we Use Widgets
- Explored Flutter Widget Catalogue  and tried the basic text widget

**Thoughts:**
- Emulator is giving me some issue need to fix that rest all was pretty good !!
### Day 8: [31th August]

**Today's Progress:**
- Last App was just using Single Widget the Text() Widget.
- Now i tried using Nested widgets like scaffold, Container, Box Decoration, Center etc for 
- Tried Adding Gradients, Font Size, Font Weight 

This is how the image looks

**Thoughts:**

### Day 9: [3rd September]

**Today's Progress:**
- Learnt to make Custom Widgets and use them into code. 
- We can use these Widgets as reusable widgets.
- Tried Making the Linktree Clone in UI aspect in Flutter
- Used Widget Nesting, Learnt adding Network Images, Using Google Fonts, Custom Widgets, Scaffold, Column etc Widgets.

**Thoughts:**
- This is same as the React.js component reusing and quite similar too. UI Building in Flutter is a bit Tough

**Today's Progress:**
- Learned to make Buttons and redirect them to a website. any External Links.
- Tried Nesting widgets like InkWell, Containers, etc on child and children modes.
